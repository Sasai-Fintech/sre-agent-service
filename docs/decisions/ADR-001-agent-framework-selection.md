# ADR-001: Agent Framework Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to choose an agent framework for the SRE agent system that can handle high-performance, concurrent agent operations with minimal resource overhead.

## Decision
We will use Agno AgentOS over LangChain for the following reasons:

### Performance Comparison
- **Agno AgentOS**: 3μs instantiation time, 6,656 bytes memory per agent
- **LangChain**: 1,178μs instantiation time, 136,649 bytes memory per agent
- **Performance Gain**: 400x faster instantiation, 20x less memory usage

### Scalability Benefits
- Agno AgentOS can handle 1000+ concurrent agents
- LangChain limited to 100-200 concurrent agents
- Better suited for our 100 concurrent request requirement

### MCP Integration
- Agno AgentOS has native MCP server discovery and tool integration
- LangChain requires manual MCP integration
- Reduces development complexity and maintenance overhead

## Consequences

### Positive
- Significantly better performance for concurrent operations
- Lower memory footprint reduces infrastructure costs
- Native MCP integration simplifies development
- Better suited for cloud-native deployment

### Negative
- Smaller community compared to LangChain
- Newer framework with less ecosystem maturity
- Fewer third-party integrations available
- Less documentation and examples available

### Risks
- Dependency on a less mature framework
- Potential for breaking changes in newer versions
- Limited community support for complex issues
- Vendor lock-in to Agno AgentOS

## Implementation Notes
- Use Agno AgentOS 1.0.0+ for production stability
- Implement fallback mechanisms for missing features
- Document any workarounds needed for Agno AgentOS limitations
- Monitor framework updates and breaking changes
- Maintain compatibility layer for potential future migration

## Alternatives Considered
1. **LangChain**: Rejected due to performance limitations
2. **Custom Framework**: Rejected due to development overhead
3. **AutoGen**: Rejected due to complexity and resource requirements
